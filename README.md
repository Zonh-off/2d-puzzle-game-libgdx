## Description
This game project was made in order to learn how to make a game using **LibGDX**, so the project has lots of bugs and is unlikely to ever be completed. 

The goal of the game is to find the correct path for a sphere that will travel from the starting point to the endpoint. You need to rotate arrows that will guide the sphere.
## Controls
- **F3**: Switch levels
- **F1**: Reset to the first level
- **F1**: Debugger

## Purpose
